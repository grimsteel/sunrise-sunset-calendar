# Sunrise Sunset Calendar

https://grimsteel.github.io/sunrise-sunset-calendar/

Generate an iCal file for sunrise and sunset times for a given location

This file can then be imported into Google Calendar or other calendar applications.

## How it works

I used NOAA's [Solar Calculator](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/) for the algorithm for calculating the sunrise/sunset times based on the latitude, longitude, and timezone of the location.

**Resources**:

- [Sunrise and Sunset Calculator](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/)
- [NOAA Sunrise/Sunset Spreadsheet](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/NOAA_Solar_Calculations_year.xls)
- [PDF Explanation](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/solareqns.PDF)

I don't understand the math behind it, (it seems like magic!) but it seems to work pretty well!
